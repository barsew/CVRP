# CVRP
 Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Ant colony optimization algorithms (plus modifications)

Project Description

This project focuses on applying the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The objective is to find optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles delivering goods from a central warehouse to customers. Each vehicle has a limited capacity and a maximum travel distance constraint.

The project compares three approaches to solving CVRP:

The basic version of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm,

Two modified versions of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm,

A greedy algorithm as a benchmark.

Methodology

The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is a heuristic approach inspired by the behavior of ant colonies in finding the shortest path to food. In this project, two modifications will be tested:

Elite Ant System - additional pheromone reinforcement for the best global route.

Local Route Optimization (2-opt heuristic) - improving the quality of routes generated by ants.

Research Hypotheses

The ACO algorithm achieves better optimization results than the greedy algorithm but at the cost of longer computation time.

Introducing modifications to the ACO algorithm improves solution quality while maintaining acceptable performance.

The Elite Ant System further enhances solution quality.

The greedy algorithm is the fastest but produces the weakest solutions.

Hypothesis Verification Approach

Computer experiments will be conducted on test datasets of varying sizes and structures. The evaluation metrics used will be:

Solution quality (route cost),

Computation time,

Solution stability across different problem instances.

A statistical analysis of the results will allow for a comparison of the effectiveness and efficiency of the methods.

Technology

The project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:

NetworkX - graph representation of the problem,

NumPy - numerical computations,

Matplotlib - visualization of results,

Pandas - processing test data.
